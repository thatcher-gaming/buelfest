            BUELFEST is an online music festival from Nov. 1st to Nov. 7th,
            benefiting mutual aid for autism service dogs and Palestinians, as 
            well as several charities for Palestinian support. It centers around
            my autism service dog Bueller, meaning it starts on his birthday 
            (November 1st) and every set has an audio clip of him somewhere in it.
            Last year (the first time this event happened) we raised over $1000,
            and we hope for even more this time around. 
            You can <a href="{{links.signup.perform}}">sign up as a performer</a> 
            and/or <a href="{{links.signup.art}}">sign up as a visual artist</a>. 
            The event will take place over the week of November 1st through 7th 
            on the <a href="{{links.twitch}}">twitch channel</a>, 
            with sets due October 1st. For more information on set rules and how
