    <p>
        (todo) buelfest is a yearly urlfest I run on the week of bueller's birthday,
        Nov 1-7, that raises money for autistic kids in need of service dogs by
        directly inviting you to donate to various GoFundMes, with a raffle and
        some dog hugs as incentives. last year we raised over $1k. we open
        signups early for the people involved, some of whom compose things for
        actual orchestral ensembles, to have time to get things in order.
