            BUELFEST is an online music festival from Nov. 1st to Nov. 7th,
            benefiting mutual aid for autism service dogs and Palestinians, as
            well as several charities for Palestinian support. It centers around
            my autism service dog Bueller; it starts on his birthday and every
            set has an audio clip of him somewhere in it. Last year (the first
            time this event happened) we raised over $1000, and we hope for even
            more this time around.
