        <h2>help Distribute Aid make DIY HRT safer in the southern US</h2>
        <p class="explainer">
            Distribute Aid usually gives out humanitarian aid across the pond in various ways, but right now they're in the southern US providing trans people doing DIY HRT with the materials to do so safely. We'd like to support that effort, and we've already raised $500 for our main cause, so why not?
