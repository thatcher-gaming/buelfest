        <h2>help lio train his cool service dog</h2>
        <p class="explainer">
            Lio is a member of our community who has a lovely service dog named Muppet! (Muppy for short.)
            Unfortunately, as is often the case for those in need of service dogs, he doesn't have the time to train
            Muppy to her full capability, and training is expensive. Really expensive. As such, we'd love it if you
            donated to help him pay for it, so Muppy can do what she does best even better. Anything helps.
