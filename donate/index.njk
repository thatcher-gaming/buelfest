        <h2>help lio train his cool service dog</h2>
        <p class="explainer">
            Lio is a member of our community who has a lovely service dog named
            Muppet! (Muppy for short.) Unfortunately, as is often the case for
            those in need of service dogs, he doesn't have the time to train
            Muppy to her full capability, and training is expensive. Really
            expensive. As such, we'd love it if you donated to help him pay for
            it, so Muppy can do what she does best even better. Anything helps.

            The Palestinian Children's Relief Fund provides free medical care to
            thousands of injured and ill children currently suffering under the
            Israeli occupation of Palestine. Donating to them shows your support of
            their mission and allows them to continue doing what they do.
            Anything helps. Free Palestine.
