        <p>
            BUELFEST is an online music festival running from Nov. 1st to Nov. 7th,
            benefiting mutual aid for children in need of autism service dogs and — starting this
            year — several charities and mutual aid funds in support of Palestinians. It centers around
            my autism service dog Bueller; it starts on his birthday and every
            set has an audio clip of him somewhere in it. Last year (the first
            time this event happened) we raised over $1000, and we hope for even
            more this time around. This year, we're raising money for the training
            of a dog owned by a member of our community!
